# SBCA — Stephens Bay Cottage Association

Mobile app (React Native/Expo) for the Stephens Bay Cottage Association on Lake Muskoka, Ontario. Serves association members — primary demographic ages 55–75. **Accessibility is a first-class requirement** throughout. Hosted at `sba.camerontora.ca` and `*.sba.camerontora.ca`.

## Status

Current status: `active` (Phase 1 & 2 complete; Phase 3 admin portal in progress)
Last meaningful change: 2026-04-09 (nginx domain routing docs, metro.sba subdomain)

## Architecture

Monorepo:

```
sbca/
├── app/          ← React Native (Expo SDK 55, Expo Router)
├── backend/      ← Fastify API (Node 20, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL 16)
├── admin/        ← Admin web portal (Next.js 14) [Phase 3, in progress]
└── infrastructure/ ← Docker Compose (Postgres + MinIO + API)
```

API on port 3003 → nginx → `https://sba.camerontora.ca`
MinIO: API port 9010, console port 9011

### Mobile Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Framework | React Native, Expo SDK 55 |
| Routing | Expo Router (file-based) |
| State | Zustand |
| HTTP | Axios + JWT interceptors |
| Auth storage | Expo SecureStore |
| Offline cache | AsyncStorage |

### Backend Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Runtime | Node.js 20, TypeScript |
| Framework | Fastify |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Object storage | MinIO (S3-compatible) — lake observation photos |
| Scheduled jobs | node-cron |

## Features

### Feature 1 — Membership Portal
- Member registration, login, JWT auth (access + refresh tokens)
- Annual dues payment via Stripe (CardField only; PaymentIntent created server-side — verified server-side to prevent client manipulation)
- Digital membership card with status and expiry
- Member directory with opt-in contact sharing
- Push notification 30 days before dues expire

### Feature 2 — Lake Health Dashboard
- Lake status indicator (Safe / Caution / Advisory) — uses emoji + colour + text, **never colour alone** (accessibility)
- Community lake observation submissions with photo upload to MinIO
- Admin approval queue before observations go public
- Water level feed from Environment Canada MSC GeoMet API (synced daily at 8 AM ET)
  - Lake Muskoka at Beaumaris: station `02EB018`
  - South Branch Muskoka River at Baysville: station `02EB008`
- 30-day water level chart with seasonal context labels
- Push notifications on significant level changes (±30 cm/week)

### Feature 3 — Events & Community Board
- Events list with category filter, RSVP, 48-hour reminder notification
- Community noticeboard with category posts and threaded replies
- Admin moderation — posts and lake reports require approval before going public

## Accessibility System (A11Y)

Primary demographic is ages 55–75. Accessibility is a first-class requirement. All screen/component code uses the `A11Y` constants object — never hardcode font sizes, colors, or touch targets.

### Font Sizes

| Key | Value | Use |
|-----|-------|-----|
| `small` | 13pt | Captions, timestamps |
| `body` | **18pt** | All body text — minimum |
| `bodyLarge` | 20pt | List item titles |
| `title` | 22pt | Section titles, button labels |
| `heading` | 26pt | Screen headings |
| `display` | 32pt | Membership card status |
| `hero` | 44pt | Status emoji, hero numbers |

### Touch Targets

| Key | Value | Use |
|-----|-------|-----|
| `min` | 44pt | Absolute minimum (Apple HIG + Material) |
| `comfortable` | 52pt | Preferred for primary actions |
| `large` | 60pt | Critical actions (Pay, Submit) |

### Colors (All WCAG 2.1 AA)

| Key | Hex | Contrast on white | Use |
|-----|-----|-------------------|-----|
| `primary` | `#1A5276` | 7.8:1 | Brand blue, links, focus |
| `success` | `#1E8449` | 5.1:1 | Safe status |
| `warning` | `#B7770D` | 4.7:1 | Caution |
| `danger` | `#C0392B` | 5.2:1 | Advisory, errors |
| `text` | `#1A1A2E` | 16.9:1 | Primary body text |
| `textSecondary` | `#555555` | 7.0:1 | Secondary text |
| `textMuted` | `#777777` | 4.6:1 | Large text only |

### Key Rules

1. **Status indicators use three channels**: emoji + colour + plain text — never colour alone (e.g., lake status: ✅ Safe / ⚠️ Caution / 🚫 Do Not Swim)
2. **All interactive elements** need `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, and `minHeight` ≥ 44pt
3. **Form inputs** require an explicit visible label above the field, not just a placeholder
4. **Error messages** use `accessibilityRole="alert"`

## Development Architecture

| Location | Role |
|----------|------|
| MacBook | Xcode (iOS builds), iOS Simulator, CocoaPods, Android Studio |
| Ubuntu server | Source files, Claude Code, Node.js, Metro bundler (port 8081), Docker |

Rule: all code editing and `npm install` on Ubuntu; all native tooling on Mac. Files shared via SSHFS mount (`~/mnt/HOMENAS`).

## Infrastructure

- Domains: `sba.camerontora.ca`, `admin.sba.camerontora.ca`, `metro.sba.camerontora.ca` (wildcard `*.sba` cert)
- Backend: port 3003, container name `sba-api`
- Docker network: `infrastructure_default` (nginx routes to backend)
- Reverse proxy: [[wiki/infrastructure/nginx-reverse-proxy]] (nginx config `04-sba.conf`)
- SSL: shared `camerontora-services` Let's Encrypt cert (see [[wiki/infrastructure/dns-ssl]])
- **NOT behind OAuth2 Proxy** — public API with app-managed authentication (JWT)
- Nginx rate limits: auth endpoints 5 req/min per IP, general API 10 req/sec per IP (burst 20)
- Max request body: 10 MB
- Monitored by [[wiki/infrastructure/health-api]] via container `sba-api` + port 3003 health check
- iOS build requires `ios/WhosUp.xcworkspace` (not `.xcodeproj`) — use `xcworkspace` after `expo prebuild`

## Key Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/src/` | Fastify routes, Drizzle schema, scheduled jobs |
| `backend/prisma/` | DB migrations |
| `app/app/` | Expo Router pages by feature |
| `infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml` | Postgres + MinIO + API containers |
| `docs/` | Developer docs, API reference, deployment guide |

## Change Log

- 2026-04-09: nginx domain routing documented; metro.sba subdomain added
- Earlier: Phase 3 admin portal (Next.js 14) scaffolded and brought live
- Earlier: Stripe server-side payment verification; station IDs verified

## Key Decisions

- [[wiki/decisions/sbca/expo-over-bare-react-native|Expo over Bare React Native]] — Managed workflow for Ubuntu-based dev loop; `expo prebuild` + Mac for native tooling.
- [[wiki/decisions/sbca/stripe-server-side-verification|Stripe Server-side Payment Verification]] — Backend re-fetches PaymentIntent and checks metadata binding to prevent client tampering.
- [[wiki/decisions/sbca/environment-canada-api|Environment Canada MSC GeoMet API]] — Free federal hydrometric API; stations 02EB018 (Beaumaris) and 02EB008 (Baysville).
- [[wiki/decisions/sbca/expo-push-not-firebase|Expo Push over Firebase]] — Single Expo endpoint; no Firebase project or google-services.json needed.

## Known Issues

**High**
- **RSVP delete missing `eventId` filter** — `DELETE /events/:id/rsvp` deletes by `memberId` only, with no `eventId` constraint. Calling the endpoint on event B cancels the member's RSVP on event A and miscounts attendance. (`backend/src/routes/events.ts` lines 70–75)
- **Payment confirmation not transactional** — `POST /members/dues/confirm` re-fetches the Stripe `PaymentIntent` and updates the DB, but there is no transaction wrapper. If the DB update fails after Stripe confirms payment, the member remains in `expired` state despite having paid.
- **Push notification errors silently swallowed** — the Expo push batch loop catches errors and logs them but has no retry or alerting. If the Expo Push API is down, lake and dues-expiry alerts are lost without any indication.

**Medium**
- **File upload extension not validated** — `POST /upload` accepts any file extension from the client with no allowlist or MIME-type check. A user could upload arbitrary binaries to MinIO. (`backend/src/routes/upload.ts`)
- **Water level delta uses row offset, not date** — the 7-day and 30-day delta calculations use `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 7/30` (row count) rather than filtering by date. If the sync job misses a day, the delta window compresses or extends unpredictably. (`backend/src/jobs/syncWaterLevels.ts` lines 48–54)
- **Admin token (8h) has no refresh mechanism** — board members are silently logged out of the admin portal mid-session with no refresh token or "stay signed in" option.
- **Dues expiry check has a 24-hour blind spot** — the reminder cron uses a 24-hour `gte`/`lte` window. If the job skips a day or drifts in timing, members with expiry dates in the missed window never receive a renewal reminder.

**Low**
- **No pagination on lake reports** — `GET /lake/reports` returns all approved reports; the mobile app renders them all in a `ScrollView`. Will degrade on older devices as the report count grows.

## Open Questions

- Phase 3 admin portal — scope and completion status unclear from commits
